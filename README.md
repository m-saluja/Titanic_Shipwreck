# Titanic_Shipwreck_survival

Made the use of titanic dataset to predict whether a given passenger survived in the
shipwreck or not. 
The python libraries pandas and numpy were used to do the required
cleaning of the dataset and analyzing it.
The libraries seaborn and matplotlib were used to
visualize the dataset which helped in making predictions.

Conclusion: Several columns containing string values were dropped. The dataset obtained
after EDA was used to make predictions and several column correlations were used for
getting the results.
